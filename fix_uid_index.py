# Rebuild the UID index by clearing and reindexing.
# Also registers a new UID for items that have the same UID as another item.
# This can at least happen when you import a zexp twice, in different folders.
#
# One of them will keep its original UID, and you cannot influence which one this is.
# This might matter when there are resolveuid links in the site.
#
# For updates and more such scripts, see https://github.com/zestsoftware/plonescripts
#
# Run this with:
# bin/instance run scripts/fix_uid_index.py
#
# Note: this script only works on Python 3!
# But this is only because of f-strings, so should be easily fixable.
# Tested on Plone 5.2.
